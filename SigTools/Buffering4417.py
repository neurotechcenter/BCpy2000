    """
    A trap for collecting segments of signal as they come in packet by
    packet.

    A leaky trap is the simplest type:

        t = trap(1000, nchannels, leaky=True)

        t += packet_1         # these three syntaxes
        t.process(packet_2)   # are all equivalent
        t(packet_3)           # packets are channels-by-samples

    This simply stores the last 1000 samples at any given time,
    accessible with t.read()

    Non-leaky traps, on the other hand, are most effective when triggered
    by a particular signal channel.  t.trigger_channel specifies the 0-
    based index of the channel to watch, and t.trigger_threshold specifies
    the threshold that will "spring" the trap when the value of the
    (processed) trigger signal exceeds it.  t.trigger_processing (defaulting
    to numpy.abs) specifies the function by which the trigger channel is
    processed before comparison against the threshold.

    Before the trap is sprung, no samples are collected---the signal will
    only start being collected from the sample at which the threshold is
    exceeded (although if no trigger channel was specified, the trap will
    spring as soon as anything is put into it).  Once a non-leaky trap is
    full, no further samples will be stored, until the trap is emptied and
    re-armed with t.flush()

    In either case, t.full() queries whether the target number of samples
    has yet been reached.
