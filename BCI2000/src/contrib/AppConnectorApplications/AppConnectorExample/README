This directory contains the documentation and source code for the example AppConnector program. 
Here are some quick instructions for generating a makefile and building the project for Windows, 
Linux, and Macs.

Windows
-------
Make sure that you have Qt4 and MinGW installed, and that the libraries are present in your 
environment path (see the documentation pdf for more info if you have trouble). To generate the 
windows Makefile, go to the Start Menu->Run, type cmd to start the command prompt, and cd to this 
directory; you should be able to type 'dir' at the prompt, and the AppConnectorExample.pro file 
should be listed. Type 'qmake' at the prompt. The makefile is generated for your system. Now, type 
'mingw32-make release' at the prompt. It should compile, link, and build the project. The 
executable is placed in the 'release\bin\' folder. If there are problems, make sure that Qt4 and 
MinGW are installed correctly, and that the correct files are present on your path.

Linux
------
Make sure that Qt4 is installed, and that a recent version of GCC is installed (>3.6, preferably 
>=4.0). cd to the AppConnectorExample directory at a command prompt. Type 'qmake', which generates 
the Makefile. Type 'make', which builds the project. The executable is placed in the 'bin/' 
folder.

Mac
------
Make sure that Qt4 is installed, and a recent version of GCC is installed. (GCC 3.3 which is 
included with Xcode Tools 1.5 generates incorrect code; make sure you have a newer version or the 
update to 3.3). Type 'qmake' to generate the makefile, and type make to build the project.
