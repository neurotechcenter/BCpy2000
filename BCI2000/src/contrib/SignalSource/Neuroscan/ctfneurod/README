Synopsis

ctfneurod is a relay program that reads data from the CTF Acq program's RealTime 
interface, and provides them to client software over a TCP socket.
On the client side, ctfneurod implements the Neuroscan Acquire protocol.

Compiling and Linking

ctfneurod requires CTF's development SDK. It links against the ctfds and ctfutil libraries,
and requires the associated header files to compile.

Usage

ctfneurod must be started before CTF's Acq program. When started up, ctfneurod waits for
the Acq software to begin streaming data, and acts like a Neuroscan Acquire server once the 
data stream is available.
Its command line syntax is

  ctfneurod <listening address> <options>

There, the server's listening address is specified in the form <ip>:<port>, and defaults to
"localhost:4000".

Options are:
--pattern <regular expression>
-p <regular expression>
Restricts transmission to a subset of channels available on the Acq RealTime interface.
The subset is defined by matching an extended regular expression against channel names, e.g.
ctfneurod --pattern "^MLC.*"
will only transfer channels whose names begin with "MLC".
The default is to transfer all channels that are present on the Acq side.

--freqCorrection <factor>
-f <factor>
Normally, the sampling rate on the Neuroscan side is reported to be identical to the
one on the Acq side. When a correction factor is specified, this is multiplied onto the
Acq sampling rate prior to reporting the sampling rate.

--outputFormat <nbits>
-o <nbits>
Defines the bit depth of data transmission, which is either 16 or 32, and defaults to 16.
When 16 bit data transmission is selected, the lower two bits of data are ignored to avoid 
numeric overflow.

--disableHP
-d
By default, ctfneurod applies a first-order HP filter with a corner frequency of 0.1Hz
to Acq data prior to transmission. If this is undesired, use the --disableHP option to
disable HP filtering.
