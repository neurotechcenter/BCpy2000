<h1 class="pagetitle">Command Line Processing</h1><p class="subtitle">User Reference</p><hr class="sep" /><p>The purpose of the BCI2000 command-line tools is to recreate exactly, offline, the processing that BCI2000 modules perform in an online session.   This is possible because online BCI2000 modules consist of a chain of <a href="User_Reference%253AFilters.html" title="User Reference:Filters">filters</a>, each filter being implemented in a self-contained source file.  We can therefore take the individual filter implementations and build them singly, as separate executables called "filter tools" that can be called from the system command-line.  Recreating a preprocessing chain offline is then a question of passing a stream of data through a chain of these filter tools, connected by an operating-system "pipe".   Supporting the beginning and end of the filter-tool chain we have additional command-line tools called format converters—for example, a tool that reads a data file to start the chain off,  or tools that save the results in ASCII or Matlab formats to finish the chain. 
</p><p>This page tells you how to use the command-line tools from a system shell, such as the Windows Command Prompt (you might know it as the "DOS window") or from a <tt>bash</tt>, <tt>tcsh</tt> or similar shell on a Unix-like system (for example, in the Mac OSX Terminal application).
</p><p>If you are using Matlab, you may wish to examine <a href="User_Reference%253AMatlab_Tools.html" title="User Reference:Matlab Tools">bci2000chain</a> instead: this uses the command-line tools, but hides the details and presents itself to you as a single Matlab function.

<a name="Introduction"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Command line interfaces are a powerful tool for dynamically combining pieces of software which are typically small programs optimized for performing a very limited functionality. With a command line interface, data processing is usually performed <i>sequentially</i> on a stream of data. This allows the processing of indefinitely large amounts of data while consuming but a finite, and often very small, amount of memory.
</p><p>Moreover, combining command line programs to perform complex tasks can be done interactively by entering complex commands directly and also in a "scripting" manner, by entering sequences of commands into text files which allow for iteration and branching. That way, automation of complex tasks can be achieved by rather simple means.
</p><p>With the BCI2000 command line interface, BCI2000 data files can be 
</p>
<ul><li><i>converted</i>  into various formats, ready for further processing with available software tools, or for visual inspection in  human readable format; 
</li><li><i>processed</i>  off-line with literally the same code as used in the on-line system. 
</li></ul>
<p>Together, these two concepts provide versatile access to recorded data in all stages of processing.
The BCI2000 command line interface may prove useful for
</p>
<ul><li>automated <i>analysis</i>  of large amounts of recorded data, 
</li><li><i>development</i>  of new filter classes, 
</li><li><i>verification</i>  of external off-line analysis methods. 
</li></ul>
<p>This document explains the command line tools available for working with BCI2000 files, and how to build BCI2000 filters as single executables that may be combined to form a chain of filters.
</p>
<a name="Command_line_interfaces"></a><h2>Command line interfaces</h2>
<p>Basically, the interface of a command line tool consists of 
</p>
<ul><li>an input stream <tt>stdin</tt>, 
</li><li>an output stream <tt>stdout</tt>, 
</li><li>an error stream <tt>stderr</tt>, 
</li><li>optional arguments (switches) controlling details of its behavior. 
</li></ul>
<p>The most important feature of a command line interface is its ability to <i>redirect</i>  streams.
</p>
<ul><li><tt>stdin</tt> can be redirected to read from a file using the  <tt>&lt;</tt> operator; 
</li><li><tt>stdout</tt> can be redirected to write to a file using the  <tt>&gt;</tt> operator; 
</li><li>one program's <tt>stdout</tt> can be plugged into another program's  <tt>stdin</tt> using the <tt>|</tt> operator ("pipe"). 
</li></ul>
<p>Because redirection is a feature of the program's execution environment ("shell"), and not a feature of the program itself, programs can be very simple, avoiding all explicit handling of input or output files. 
</p><p>The following example command line will extract the "sampling rate" parameter from the BCI2000 data file <tt>mydata.dat</tt>, and display the result on the text console:
</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream &lt; mydata.dat | bci_stream2prm | grep SamplingRate
</pre>
<a name="Building_BCI2000_command_line_tools"></a><h2>Building BCI2000 command line tools</h2>
<p>Command line tools are built automatically by the BCI2000 build system if building of BCI2000 tools is enabled.
</p><p>In order to use the command line tools, you will need to add the full path 
to the <tt>BCI2000/Tools/cmdline</tt> directory to your system's PATH environment variable. (Please consult your operating system documentation for details on environment variables.)
</p>
<a name="Stream_format"></a><h2>Stream format</h2>
<p>The common format used to exchange data between BCI2000 command line tools is called a "BCI2000 binary stream," or just "stream." Such a "stream" transfers parameters, states, and data in exactly the same binary format as is used for socket communication between the four main modules of the BCI2000 real-time system.
</p><p>The stream format is different from the BCI2000 <tt>dat</tt> and <tt>prm</tt> file formats, and is not human readable. A number of tools are available to convert data either to or from stream format.
As the stream format is only used between tools, and generally not of interest to the user, a typical conversion will use <i>two</i>  of the tools provided, one to translate the original file into a "stream," and one to translate the stream into the desired format.
</p><p>E.g., to display a <tt>dat</tt> file's contents in a human readable format, one would use a tool called <tt>bci_dat2stream</tt> to convert it into a stream, and then use another tool called <tt>bci_stream2asc</tt> to convert the stream into text. If you want the output to appear in the text window as a sequence of pages, you pipe it into the "more" program:
</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream &lt; myfile.dat | bci_stream2asc | more
</pre>
<a name="Conversion_into_stream_format"></a><h3>Conversion into stream format</h3>
<a name="bci_dat2stream"></a><h4><tt>bci_dat2stream</tt></h4>
<a name="Input_format"></a><h5>Input format</h5>
<p><tt>bci_dat2stream</tt> converts a BCI2000 data (<tt>dat</tt>) file into a stream.
</p>
<a name="Options"></a><h5>Options</h5>
<p>The <tt>--transmit</tt> option may be used to select states, parameters, and data for transmission, as in
</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream --transmit-sp &lt; myfile.dat
</pre>
<p>In the above example, only states and parameters but no data will be contained in the resulting stream. "Data" comprises signal and state vector data.
Omitting a <tt>--transmit</tt> option corresponds to<tt>--transmit-spd</tt>. This transmits all information contained in the <tt>dat</tt> file.
</p><p>When the <tt>--raw</tt> option is given, data are transmitted in raw, i.e. uncalibrated, form. By default, data are transmitted in calibrated form, using the calibration information from the <tt>SourceChOffset</tt> and <tt>SourceChGain</tt> parameters.
</p><p>The <tt>-p</tt> or <tt>--parameters</tt> option allows some or all of the parameter values stored in the data file to be overridden by values from a named parameter file—for example:
</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream -pMyParameters.prm &lt; myfile.dat
</pre>
<a name="bci_prm2stream"></a><h4><tt>bci_prm2stream</tt></h4>
<p><tt>bci_prm2stream</tt> converts a BCI2000 parameter (<tt>prm</tt>) file into a stream.
</p>
<a name="Conversion_from_stream_format"></a><h3>Conversion from stream format</h3>
<a name="bci_stream2prm"></a><h4><tt>bci_stream2prm</tt></h4>
<p><tt>bci_stream2prm</tt> converts a stream into a BCI2000 parameter (<tt>prm</tt>) file. As a parameter file is just a sequence of parameter lines, this is also a text-only, human readable format.
</p>
<a name="bci_stream2asc"></a><h4><tt>bci_stream2asc</tt></h4>
<p><tt>bci_stream2asc</tt> converts a stream into a human readable format. Each object contained in the stream will appear as its C++ type name, followed by an opening brace, its content, and a closing brace. The content will appear as defined by the stream inserter <tt>operator&gt;&gt;</tt> for the object's type.
</p><p>In the output of BCI2000 state vector information, each state will appear on its own line, thus values of certain states may be easily extracted using the <tt>grep</tt> program.
</p>
<a name="bci_stream2table"></a><h4><tt>bci_stream2table</tt></h4>
<p><tt>bci_stream2table</tt> converts a stream into a tab-separated table containing state and signal values in ASCII format. Each state, and each signal entry, has its own column. The first line of output begins with a <tt>#</tt> comment character, and contains a tab-separated list of column headers. This format is best suited for data import into applications that use tables.
</p>
<a name="bci_stream2mat"></a><h4><tt>bci_stream2mat</tt></h4>
<p><tt>bci_stream2mat</tt> converts a stream into a Matlab binary file. The output <tt>.mat</tt> file contains two Matlab variables called <tt>Index</tt> and <tt>Data</tt>. Of these, the <tt>Data</tt> variable is a matrix with each column representing a BCI2000 data block (comprising state information and signal data). <tt>Index</tt> is a Matlab structure that contains indices into the <tt>Data</tt> rows, allowing access to BCI2000 states by name, as in:
</p>
<pre>myMatlabVariable = squeeze( Data( Index.TargetCode,&nbsp;: ) );
</pre>
<p>As each BCI2000 data block contains a signal which is a two-dimensional matrix (channels by elements), the signal index is itself a matrix. To copy the first channel's data into a Matlab variable, write
</p>
<pre>myChannel1 = squeeze( Data( Index.Signal( 1,&nbsp;: ),&nbsp;: ) );
</pre>
<p>For convenience, there is a Matlab function provided that simplifies reading <tt>bci_stream2mat</tt> output files into Matlab variables:
</p>
<pre>[ mySignal, myTargetCode ] = load_bcimat( 'eegdata.mat', 2, 'TargetCode' );
</pre>
<p>This function takes the file name as its first argument. In a second argument, specify the number of dimensions your output signal will have -- typically, this will be 2 for EEG-like data (samples by channels), and 3 for spectral data (blocks by bins by channels). Remaining arguments are treated as state names; the associated state data will be written into the variables specified as remaining output arguments. State variables will always be one-dimensional, with their number of entries matching the first dimension of the signal variable.
</p><p>Note that if you are using Matlab, you may prefer to use <tt>bci2000chain</tt> from the <a href="User_Reference%253AMatlab_Tools.html" title="User Reference:Matlab Tools">suite of BCI2000 matlab tools</a>, instead of calling the command-line tools plus <tt>load_bcimat</tt> by hand.

<a name="Compiling_an_existing_filter_as_a_command_line_tool"></a><h3>Compiling an existing filter as a command line tool</h3>
<p>Adding a new command-line filter tool to your BCI2000 solution file or Makefile requires use of CMake as described in the <a href="Programming_Reference%253ABuild_System.html" title="Programming Reference:Build System">build system documentation</a>.  The simplest example is when you have a filter implementation in files <tt>MyFilter.cpp</tt> and <tt>MyFilter.h</tt>, in a directory <tt>MyDir</tt> on their own. Let us assume that this is a subdirectory of <tt>src/custom</tt> since this is an area of the BCI2000 distribution reserved for your own code (if <tt>src/custom</tt> does not already exist, create it—the BCI2000 CMake system will find it automatically).  To add the command-line filter, first ensure that CMake reaches your subdirectory. This is done by appending the appropriate line to <tt>src/custom/CMakeLists.txt</tt>&nbsp;:
</p>
<pre>ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(  MyDir  )
</pre>
<p>Then you need to create a <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> file inside <tt>MyDir</tt>, containing the following line:
</p>
<pre>BCI2000_ADD_CMDLINE_FILTER( MyFilter )
</pre>
<p>Finally you need to go back to the top-level <tt>build</tt> and run CMake using one of the scripts there (<tt>Make......bat</tt> on Windows,  or <tt>Make Unix Makefiles.sh</tt> on OSX and other unix-like systems).  You need to ensure that your build is configured to include the BCI2000 Tools:  if you have previously run CMake and need to change this setting, you can either delete <tt>CMakeCache.txt</tt> from the <tt>build</tt> directory before running the script,  or run <tt>cmake -i</tt> (decline the offer to see advanced options).
</p><p>Assuming this is successful, you can re-open your solution file and see MyFilter listed among the targets—or, for Makefile-based builds, you can simply type
</p>
<pre>make MyFilter
</pre>
<p>The executable <tt>MyFilter</tt> (or <tt>MyFilter.exe</tt>) is built in the <tt>tools/cmdline</tt> directory.  Assuming this directory is on the system path, you can verify that the executable has built successfully by typing
</p>
<pre>MyFilter --help
</pre>
<p>You should get a message stating that the program applies the "MyFilter" filter to its input.
</p><p>One potential complication is that the <tt>BCI2000_ADD_CMDLINE_FILTER</tt> macro cannot come in the same <tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt> file as the declaration of a BCI2000 module.   Let us suppose you have followed the <a href="Programming_Howto%253AQuickstart_Guide.html" title="Programming Howto:Quickstart Guide">programmers' quickstart guide</a> to create a custom signal-processing module in <tt>src/custom/MyModule</tt> and add a custom filter <tt>MyFilter</tt> to it.  A safe procedure (which can be automated used the <a href="Programming_Howto%253AQuickstart_Guide.html#Configuring_your_new_filter_for_offline_use" title="Programming Howto:Quickstart Guide">NewBCI2000FilterTool</a> utility) is as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> Create a subdirectory <tt>src/custom/MyModule/cmdline</tt>
</li><li> Insert the line <tt>ADD_SUBDIRECTORY( cmdline )</tt> at the <i>beginning</i> of <tt>src/custom/MyModule/CMakeLists.txt</tt> (it must come <i>before</i> the module declaration).
</li><li> Create the file <tt>src/custom/MyModule/cmdline/CMakeLists.txt</tt> containing the following line:
</li></ol>
<pre>BCI2000_ADD_CMDLINE_FILTER( MyFilter FROM .. )
</pre>
<p>Further instructive examples, of what to do when your filter needs to be linked to additional C++ source or external libraries,  can be found in <tt>src/core/Tools/cmdline/CMakeLists.txt</tt>&nbsp;:
</p>
<pre>SET( SIGPROC_DIR ${BCI2000_ROOT_DIR}/src/shared/modules/signalprocessing )

BCI2000_ADD_CMDLINE_FILTER( ARFilter              FROM ${SIGPROC_DIR}    # because ARFilter.cpp and ARFilter.h reside there
                            INCLUDING "MATH"                             # because the "MATH" external library is required
                            EXTRA_SOURCES ${SIGPROC_DIR}/ARThread.cpp    # because the filter relies on one or more additional source files
                            EXTRA_HEADERS ${SIGPROC_DIR}/ARThread.h )    # ...and their corresponding headers

BCI2000_ADD_CMDLINE_FILTER( LinearClassifier      FROM ${SIGPROC_DIR} )  # a simpler example
</pre>
<a name="Offline-only_filters"></a><h3>Offline-only filters</h3>
<p>For off-line analysis, data must often be partitioned into "segments" before performing statistics. As there is no notion of "segments" in the on-line data and file format, we suggest using the "Running" state to indicate segments in the following way:
</p><p>When performing a segmenting task, a filter sets the "Running" state to zero outside segments. A statistics filter will then perform buffering from its <tt>Process()</tt> function, and act on the buffered data from its <tt>StartRun()</tt> and <tt>StopRun()</tt> functions.
</p><p>Note that setting the "Running" state to zero inside the on-line system will suspend the on-line system, so this kind of segmenting and statistics filtering cannot be used on-line.
</p>
<a name="Examples"></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following examples work from the Windows NT command prompt. Nevertheless, we would like to point the reader to the free <i>cygwin</i>  collection of GNU tools ported to the Win32 API. <i>Cygwin</i>  provides the power of the <tt>bash</tt> shell, and of programs like the <tt>sed</tt> stream editor. 
Although the BCI2000 command line tools cannot be <b>compiled</b> from within <i>cygwin</i>, they work fine when <b>called</b> from <i>cygwin</i> .
</p>
<a name="Extracting_parameters"></a><h3>Extracting parameters</h3>
<p>To extract parameters from a data file, convert it into a stream using <tt>bci_dat2stream --transmit-p</tt>, and convert the stream into a parameter file using <tt>bci_stream2prm</tt> as in

<pre>bci_dat2stream &lt; mydata.dat | bci_stream2prm &gt; myprms.prm

</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream -pMyParameters.prm &lt; MyData.dat | MyFilter | bci_stream2table &gt; MyTable.txt

<a name="Processing_data_with_BCI2000_filters_and_importing_the_results_into_Matlab"></a><h3>Processing data with BCI2000 filters and importing the results into Matlab</h3>
<p>First, consider using the higher-level Matlab interface <a href="User_Reference%253AMatlab_Tools.html" title="User Reference:Matlab Tools">bci2000chain</a> instead.  But if you decide you want to do it by hand, and you want to process data with the filters used in the mu-training on-line system, saving the AR spectrum as Matlab file, execute 
</p>
<pre>bci_dat2stream &lt; mydata.dat | TransmissionFilter | SpatialFilter | ARFilter | bci_stream2mat &gt; myspectra.mat
</pre>
<p>Load the data into Matlab using
</p>
<pre>[ signal, TargetCode ] = load_bcimat( 'myspectra.mat', 3, 'TargetCode' );
</pre>
<p>This requires that the file <tt>load_bcimat.m</tt> is accessible from the Matlab search path.

<a name="Testing_a_modified_filter_on_existing_data"></a><h3>Testing a modified filter on existing data</h3>
<p>To verify that changes to a filter's code don't change its behavior with respect to existing data, apply both versions to a stream, convert the output stream into human readable format, and have a file comparison program display any differences. For the following example, we will compare a previous version of the ARFilter, renamed <tt>prev_ARFilter</tt>, to the current one.
</p>
<ol><li>Create a stream suitable for input to the ARFilter:<br /><code>bci_dat2stream &lt; mydata.dat | TransmissionFilter | SpatialFilter &gt; test.bcistream</code>
</li><li>Apply both filter versions to the stream, and save the results in human readable format:<br /><code>ARFilter &lt; test.bcistream | bci_stream2asc &gt; ARresult.txt &amp;&amp;  prev_ARFilter &lt; test.bcistream | bci_stream2asc &gt; prev_ARresult.txt</code>
</li><li>Compare the results (using the Windows NT analog to the <tt>diff</tt> program):<br /><code>comp /a /l prev_ARresult.txt ARresult.txt | more</code>
