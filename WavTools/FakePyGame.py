"""
This module is not imported by WavTools by default.
If imported explicitly, it provides a duck-typed partial
clone of the pygame.mixer.Sound object.

If you say:

    from WavTools.FakePyGame import mixer, Sound

then the interface is similar to what you get from saying:

    from pygame import mixer; from pygame.mixer import Sound

mixer.init() is a necessary call for pygame, but in
FakePyGame it simply does nothing.  WavTools.player objects
become known as Sound, and there are Sound.get_length() and
Sound.set_volume() methods as in pygame.
