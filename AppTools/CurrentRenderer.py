This module provides an interface from the AppTools to the
BciGenericRenderer subclass currently imported by the runnning
BCPy2000 BciApplication instance, if any.

By default, the renderer is of subclass VisionEggRenderer. By
the end of the Construct phase, this will have been instantiated:
from the BciApplication object's methods, that instance will be
available as self.screen.  From anywhere else, it is available
via this module's get_screen() function.

The namespace VisualStimuli will also, by the end of the Construct
phase, contain any symbols that were exported by the module in
which the renderer subclass was defined. VisualStimuli is available
here, and also as a global object in the namespace in which
BciApplication.py is run.
